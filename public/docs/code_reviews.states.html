                  Reviews can be in one of several states. The biggest differentiator is
                      whether the review's files have any outstanding, uncommitted changes or not.
                    
               </p>
               <p>
                      Whenever a review's state changes, an email notification is sent to all
                      review participants, including the author, anyone who comments on the review
                      or its files, anyone who has changed the review's state previously, and
                      anyone who is <a class="link" href="basics.notable.html#basics.notable.mentions" title="@mentions">@mentioned</a> in
                      the review's description or comments.

                  <p>
                           By default, when an <span class="guilabel">Approved</span> review is committed or
                           updated, Swarm changes the state to <span class="guilabel">Needs Review</span> if
                           the files have been modified since the review was approved. Files are
                           considered modified if the list of involved files changes, or if the file
                           content or file-type changes.

                  <p>
                           If one or more files in a review has the filetype <code class="literal">+k</code>
                           (<code class="literal">ktext</code>), this behavior is undesirable because the files
                           will appear to be modified when the Helix Versioning Engine replaces RCS
                           keywords with their current values. See
                           <a class="xref" href="admin.unapprove_modified.html" title="Unapprove modified reviews">Unapprove modified reviews</a> to see how to disable this

                           By default, review authors can approve their own reviews. This behavior is
                           based on Swarm's <a class="link" href="chapter.code_reviews.html#code_reviews.index.advisory" title="Advisory nature">advisory

                           Self-approval by authors can be prohibited on a project-by-project basis
                           by specifying moderators for project branches (see the
                           <a class="link" href="code_reviews.states.html#code_reviews.states.moderation" title="State change restrictions with moderation">next section</a>).
                           However, authors who are moderators can self-approve their own reviews.

                  <p>
                           Administrators can configure Swarm to prevent all self-approval by review
                           authors. See <a class="xref" href="admin.reviews.html#admin.reviews.disable_self_approve" title="Disable self-approval of reviews by authors">Disable self-approval of reviews by authors</a> for

                           Typically, any authenticated user can change the state of a review
                           (remember that the review state is merely advisory in most cases). When
                           the <span class="guilabel">Only Moderators can approve or reject reviews</span>
                           restriction is enabled for a project branch, and one or more
                           <a class="link" href="projects.add.html#projects.add.moderators">moderators</a> have been
                           assigned to that branch (see <a class="xref" href="projects.add.html" title="Add a project">Add a project</a> for details),
                           that branch is <span class="emphasis"><em>moderated</em></span>. Changing the state of any
                           review associated with a moderated branch is restricted as follows:

                                    Only moderators can approve or reject the review. Moderators can also
                                    transition a review to any other state.

                           Reviews can optionally have required reviewers. When a review has required
                           reviewers, the review cannot be <span class="guilabel">Approved</span> until all
                           required reviewers have up-voted the review. If the review is associated
                           with a project that has assigned moderators, even the moderators cannot
                           approve the review without up-votes from all required reviewers (but they
                           can reject the review).
                         
                  </p>
                  <p>
                           Required reviewers are expected to take greater care while performing a
                           review than non-required reviewers, as their votes affect whether a review
                           can be approved or not.

                                          description, select which jobs should be associated, and specify the
                                          job status upon commit. When you click the <span class="guibutton">Approve and
                                             Commit</span> button, the review becomes approved and its
                                          associated files are committed. By default, Swarm's activity stream
                                          entries and email notifications note that you committed the review
                                          on behalf of the review's author. This can be configured to credit
                                          only the committer, see <a class="xref" href="admin.commit_credit.html" title="Commit credit">Commit credit</a> for

                                               By default, if the committer is not the review's author, Swarm

                                          Sometimes, a changelist that a review is based upon gets committed
                                          without the review being updated. In such a situation, selecting
                                          <span class="guimenuitem">Already Committed...</span> displays a dialog
                                          presenting a list of candidate changelists:
                                        
                           </p>

                           </p>
                           <p>
                                          Specify the changelist, if you know it, or browse the recent changes
                                          to locate the submitted change. The first field under
                                          <span class="guilabel">History</span> allows you to filter changes by depot
                                          path. The second field allows you to filter changes by userid. Click
                                          a changelist to select it, and then click
                                          <span class="guibutton">Select</span> to associate the changelist with the
                                          review and complete the review.  Or, just double-click a changelist
                                          to do the same.
                                        
                           </p>

                           When a review has been committed, sometimes a follow-up change needs to be
                           associated with the review. For committed reviews, the drop-down menu
                           provides the <span class="guimenuitem">Add a commit...</span> entry in place of
                           <span class="guimenuitem">Already Committed...</span>. Select <span class="guimenuitem">Add a
                              commit...</span> to use the <span class="guilabel">Select Change</span>
                           dialog as described above.
